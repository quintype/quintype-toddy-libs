*This library is part of the [Malibu Framework](https://developers.quintype.com/malibu)*.

The Quintype framework handles most of the heavy lifting in the application for you.

It handles a number of functionality, such as
* The isomorphic rendering
* Automatically forwarding things like amp pages upstream
* Following redirects that are set up in the editor

For an explanation of the architecture of this library, please see [Malibu Documentation](https://developers.quintype.com/malibu/isomorphic-rendering).

The most important module for configuring your server is {@link module:routes routes}.
