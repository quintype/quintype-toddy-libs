# @quintype/framework

This is the framework that powers Malibu.

Please see [Isomorphic Rendering](https://developers.quintype.com/malibu/isomorphic-rendering) for an overview of the architecture of this library.

The Documentation is available here: [https://developers.quintype.com/quintype-node-framework](https://developers.quintype.com/quintype-node-framework)

Please see [malibu](https://github.com/quintype/malibu) for a reference application using this architecture.

Some Topics which are not covered in the documentation (yet), are below

## Implementing a new page

In your server.js, you will notice something like the following

```javascript
isomorphicRoutes(app, {
  generateRoutes: generateRoutes,
  loadData: loadData,
  pickComponent: pickComponent,
});
```

This highlights the three important places to put stuff for an isomorphic app

- Match the route against a `pageType`, typically in `app/server/routes.js` (see the routing section above)
- Load the Data Required for that `pageType`, typically in `app/server/load-data.js`. This returns a promise with required data.
- Render the correct component for that `pageType`, typically in `app/isomorphic/pick-component.js`. This must be a pure component

## Forcing Updates

Since is difficult to force Service Workers to update, there is a provision to do such a thing. Add the following to the correct places. Whenever a change is to be forcefully pushed, update the version in app-version.js. The next AJAX page load via `/route-data.json` will force the service worker to update in the background (and the next refresh will have changes).

Ideally, you will have to push this after purging caches on /shell.html and the service worker.

```javascript
// app/isomorphic/app-version.js

module.exports = 1;

// app/server/app.js
import {isomorphicRoutes} from "@quintype/framework/server/routes";
isomorphicRoutes(app, {
  ...
  appVersion: require("../isomorphic/app-version")
  ...
});

// app/client/app.js
startApp(renderApplication, CUSTOM_REDUCERS, {
  ...
  appVersion: require("../isomorphic/app-version")
  ...
});

// views/js/service-worker.ejs
const REQUIRED_ASSETS = [
  {url: '/shell.html', revision: '<%= appVersion %>'},
  ...
];
```

## Structure of the /route-data.json

The response of the /route-data.json will look like the following:

```javascript
{
  appVersion: 42,
  title: "This is the title of the page",
  // When multi domain support is enabled, this will be the canonical url of the domainSlug.
  // See multi domain support for more information
  currentHostUrl: "https://canonical-root.your-host.com",
  primaryHostUrl: "https://www.your-host.com",
  // your loadData function is responsible for loading this entire data
  data: {
    pageType: "story-page",
    story: {}
  }
}
```

## Multi Domain Support

Multi domain support is achieved by assigning a section to a domain via the domain manager in the editor. Once this is done, add the following entries into your `publisher/config.yml`.

```yaml
# publisher/config.yml
domain_mapping:
  subdomain.my-domain.com: sub
  another.my-domain.com: another
```

Doing this will enable a field called `domainSlug` to be passed to various functions, such as `generateRoutes` and `loadData`. This can be used to load data specific to the domain.

Further, `/route-data.json` will have two more fields at the root level. `domainSlug`, which is the slug of the loaded domain. `currentHostUrl` specifies which domain you are on. The `currentHostUrl` is used by the link field to decide if it should do an ajax navigation or not.

## Visual Stories (amp stories)	

In order to use the visual-stories, do the following in `app/server/app.js`	

```javascript	
import { enableVisualStories } from "@quintype/framework/server/visual-stories";	
function renderVisualStory(res, story, { config, client }) {	
  res.render("pages/visual-story", {	
    seo: "",	
    content: ReactDom.renderToStaticMarkup(<amp-story></amp-story>),	
  });	
}	
enableVisualStories(app, renderVisualStory, { logError });	
```

## Debugging

- In order to use `assetify` function, please annotate the application-js with id="app-js". The hostname specified here is assumed to be the cdn
- All code related to the browser loading the service worker can be found in [load-service-worker.js](client/load-service-worker.js)
- All code related to the service worker itself is found in [service-worker-helper.js](client/service-worker-helper.js)

## Miscellaneous

### Switching to generateCommonRoutes

Starting in `@quintype/framework` v3, we are introducing multi domain support. The configuration for section page locations is now controlled by the editor. Please switch to using `generateCommonRoutes` to generate story page, and section page routes.

```javascript
import { generateCommonRoutes } from "@quintype/framework/server/generate-routes";

export function generateRoutes(config, domainSlug) {
  return generateCommonRoutes(config, domainSlug, {
    sectionPageRoutes: true,
    storyPageRoutes: true,
  });
}
```

### OneSignal Integration

OneSignal interferes with our service worker, so a few changes have to be made to enable PWA with OneSignal.

```javascript
// app/server/app.js

import {isomorphicRoutes} from "@quintype/framework/server/routes";
isomorphicRoutes(app, {
  ...
  oneSignalServiceWorkers: true
  ...
});

// app/client/app.js

startApp(renderApplication, CUSTOM_REDUCERS, {
  enableServiceWorker: true,
  serviceWorkerLocation: "/OneSignalSDKWorker.js", // OneSignal will automatically register the service worker
})
```

### FCM Integration

Steps to Integrate FCM in your project

1. While executing startApp in your project set enableFCM to true.

An Example

```
startApp(renderApplication,
  CUSTOM_REDUCERS,
  {
  enableServiceWorker: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  enableFCM: true,
  ...
})
```

2. publisher_config.yml should have the fcm configuration as below:

```
    fcm:
      message_sender_id: <MessageSenderId>
      serverKey: <ServerKey>
```

3. You should have service worker script named firebase-messaging-sw.js in /public

   Example of the script:

   ```
       importScripts("https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/4.8.1/firebase-app.js");
       importScripts("https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/4.8.1/firebase-messaging.js");
       firebase.initializeApp({
         messagingSenderId: <your message sender Id>
       });
       const messaging = firebase.messaging();
       function messageHandler(payload) {
         const data = payload["data"];

         var notificationTitle = data.title;
         var notificationOptions = {
           body: data.body,
           icon: data["hero_image_s3_url"],
           image: data["hero_image_s3_url"],
           data: data
         };

         return self.registration.showNotification(notificationTitle,
           notificationOptions);
       }
       messaging.setBackgroundMessageHandler(messageHandler);
   ```

4. Make sure that the page data should have config with key fcmMessageSenderId refer doStartApp function in app/client/start.js.

### Skipping loading data from /route-data.json

This can be used where `/route-data.json` is not accessible (example preview).

Add the following:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  var staticPageStoreContent = <%- JSON.stringify(store.getState()) -%>;
</script>
```

The store will be initialized from staticPageStoreContent

### Using Assets in JS and CSS

(to be documented)

## Minimizing Page Load Speed

Make sure you do all of the following techniques to reduce page load time (notes to document these later)

### Inline CSS

### Add a window.initialFetch to do a fetch in the background

### Add a initial-page to preRender chrome such as the menu without waiting for AJAX responses

```html
<script type="application/json" id="initial-page">
  { "config": {} }
</script>
```

### Use static-page to show a full page (this will prevent fetchData from calling)

```html
<script type="application/json" id="static-page">
  { "config": {} }
</script>
```

### Never require lodash directly. Always do lodash/get

### Do not use moment. Use date-fns

### LazyLoad Images

### Separate polyfills

### Use Link headers to do HTTP2 server push to prioritize important requests

Preloading app.js and /route-data.json can be triggered by passing preloadJS true, and preloadRouteData true to isomorphic handler

## Options

### manifest-fn

### forwardAmp

### multiple publishers

FIXME: Write notes on `host_to_api_host`, `host_to_automatic_api_host` and `skip_warm_config`

### forwardFavicon

```sh
sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quintype/quintype-node-framework/master/scripts/framework-2-to-3-migration)
```

- Verify Changes with `git diff --cached`
